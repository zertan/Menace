PTR Extraction Software
This bundle of scripts is a basic implementation of the algorithm for extracting Peak-to-Trough Ratios from Metagenomic data, as first described by Korem et. al (Korem et. al, Science, 2015).

The implementation follows a 

Below follows a description of the main scripts in the package:

###########

jobscript.sh

A submit script for sending a batch job to slurm for parallel processing on a computing cluster.

input: none
output: none

###########

mainBuild.sh

The main build script with commands intended to be executed on the cluster. 

input: none
output: temporary paths and files on computing nodes

###########

PTRBuild.py

Traverses the specified directory generated by mainBuild.sh and assembles information from each sample into tabular form.

input: directory structure, reference files
output: Abundance.csv, 

###########

piecewiseFit.py

Implements the piecewise linear fit and prior checks on the generated depth files to filter out those instances in which enough data was generated to produce a reliable coverage signal for estimating replication origins. This data can be used further on, once those has been estimated using the full cohort, to produce PTR-vaules for each sample.
